# SAMADHAAN
INTRODUCTION:

These Numbers might shock all of us. But that’s the truth that we cannot change at the moment. Can we  Imagine, How many Unknown Organisations still dealing With Major Problems And Working For The Same .Here, We are Talking About Planet , Plants , Animals , Soil , Water Bodies, etc. And A Lot More.

Patients, those are suffering from Diseases And Can Not Afford For Their Surgeries. So, We Make a Common Platform  For the Known As Well As Unknown  Organisations In The Form OF Web Site ,Which Will Help Them To Collaborate And Connect With Other Organisations.
We also have some future plans that can help in growth for the same. But cannot tell in front of class due to COPYRIGHT.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

There Are So Many Active Organizations As Called As Non - Governmental Organizations [NGO]
Working On The Welfare Of The Poor And Needy People And Other Major Issues / Problems. They
Have Their Own Websites But There Is An Empty Space For The Users / Donators Where
They Always Think That His / Her Donation Either It Could Be Food , Clothes , Resources ,
Medical Facilities Or Financial Support Has / Have Gone To The Right Hands Or Not.
So We Have Made A Common Platform For The Known As Well As Unknown Organization Where
They Can Connect And Do Collaborations For the Same..
